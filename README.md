# My repository for MS-Fabric-Learning
I recently had an interview for a Data Analyst role where I was asked about my experience with Fabric even though it wasn't included in the job description or person specification or skills required. I had little to no knowledge/experience with MS Fabric then so I have taken the initiative to upskill on MS Fabric.
The goal is to keep improving to ensure I am of utmost value in my role at any company.
